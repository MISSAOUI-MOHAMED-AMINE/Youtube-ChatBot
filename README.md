# ChatBot for YouTube Videos: Enhancing Video Content Interaction

The ChatBot for YouTube Videos is an innovative tool designed to transform the way users interact with YouTube content. By seamlessly integrating advanced technologies, this chatbot provides an intuitive way to extract and query information from YouTube videos.

## Key Features:
* Video to Audio Transformation

The chatbot leverages the power of the Whisper API to convert YouTube videos into high-quality audio formats, making content accessible in audio form for ease of listening and review.
* Audio Transcription

Using the Whisper API, the audio is transcribed into text, providing an accurate and searchable transcript of the video. This enables users to easily access specific parts of the content without needing to watch the entire video.
* Advanced Chatbot Integration

Built with LangChain and powered by a large language model (LLM) API, specifically the Cohere API, the chatbot can intelligently query the transcribed video content. Users can ask specific questions, and the chatbot provides precise answers by understanding the context of the video.
